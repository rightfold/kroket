Kroket is the programming language.
Frituur is the compiler.
Mosterd is a set of build utilities.
Ragout is the standard library.

Requirements:

 - Functional programming (i.e. pure and total).
 - No imprecise exceptions.
 - No unchecked exceptions.
 - Very explicit APIs: no defaults or compromises for "ease".
 - Give the programmer a lot of choice; TIMTOWTDI.
 - Pass environment facilities to main; no globals.
 - Compile all translation units in parallel.
 - Extensive standard library, no hundreds of microlibraries.
